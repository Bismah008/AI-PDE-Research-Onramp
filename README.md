# AI-PDE-Research-Onramp
## Overview
This project is my capstone for the AI-Integrated Leadership Program (AILP).  
It demonstrates how **Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** can be connected to **AI methods** in a way that is accessible for undergraduates.  
The goal is to create a reproducible "research onramp" that builds confidence and bridges theory with practice.

## Objectives
- Show how PDE modeling (heat equation) can be simplified into a micro-project.
- Use AI (linear regression) to estimate parameters from noisy data.
- Provide reflection prompts to encourage critical thinking.
- Share resources openly for reproducibility and learning.

## Frameworks Applied
- **Human–AI Collaboration**: AI assists parameter estimation, humans interpret results.
- **Psychological Safety**: Students can experiment without fear of mistakes.
- **Pyramid Principle**: Communication structured top-down for clarity.

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.  
2. Run cells step by step:
   - Import libraries
   - PDE simulation
   - Visualization
   - Synthetic noisy data
   - AI calibration
   - Reflection questions
3. Modify parameters (grid size, noise level, alpha) to explore different scenarios.

## Files
- `AI_PDE_Research_Onramp.ipynb` → Main notebook with PDE + AI workflow.
- `Capstone_Presentation.pdf` → 8-slide deck summarizing the project.
- `Survey_Questions.md` → Pre/post survey for workshop participants.
- `README.md` → Project overview and instructions.

## Reflection
This project taught me how to:
- Design accessible research pathways for undergraduates.
- Integrate PDE modeling with AI calibration.
- Apply leadership frameworks to technical education.
- Communicate research clearly through notebooks, slides, and surveys.

## Next Steps
- Expand to other PDEs (wave equation, diffusion).
- Publish additional reproducible notebooks.
- Collaborate with professors to adapt this model for undergraduate research training.
